## URI vs. URL

The terms “URI” and “URL” are often used interchangeably, but they are not exactly the same.

- A URI is an identifier of a specific resource. Like a page, or book, or a document.
- A URL is special type of identifier that also tells you how to access it, such as HTTPs, FTP, etc.—like https://www.google.com.
- If the protocol (https, ftp, etc.) is either present or implied for a domain, you should call it a URL—even though it’s also a URI.
- **All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs.**
